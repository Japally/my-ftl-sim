cleanliness
-----------
- #ifdef RELEASE_ONLY  /* DELETE ME */
- cleanup stuff from Quantum/Ross...
- clean up disk.h/iosim.h/diskface.h interface for disk-exported functions
- clean up ALPHA compilation
- why diskacctime stuff in iosim.h ?
- why mapping types in iosim.h ?
- clean up initial malloc setup
- fix Makefile to figure out inter-file dependencies automatically (bucy -- DONE 6/12/2001)
- clean iotrace/iosim code scramble
- fix-up iotrace/synthio support for having multiple traces
  (perhaps all traces should be fed thru synthio??)
- clean up checkpoint/restore/disksim code
- deal with currdisk->maxqlen awkwardness (is it QueueLength or outstanding?)
- replace global "device" structure (used by driver and ctlr) with "virtdev"
  (to avoid confusion with _device.[ch] code)
- fix Makefile and Makefile.ALL syncing problem for building with SimOS
- robustness, testing harness, and a lot more testing


documentation
-------------
- document new cache, cachemem, cachedev stuff
- document common errors (see common.errors in doc/)
- all the other stuff recently changed and added (freebw, mems, etc...)


functionality
-------------
- implement ctlorgs
- clean up freeblock scheduling integration
- new interconnection scheme (better scalability and error reporting)
- redo disk caching code (comprehensible and more up-to-date)
- add a device_cleanup call to allow for memory garbage collection now
  that we're using malloc instead of DISKSIM_malloc

bug fixes
---------
- type "1" buses at top level when there are multiple levels of controllers


questions
---------
- DiskSim ASPTF problem
- look at diskctlr prefetch tracking
- look at diskctlr seek, rotation, etc breakdowns


release changes
---------------
- remove MEMS, DEC, and other unready stuff from source code
- remove doc.src, doc/Outline.txt and TODO
- move latest doc.src/main.ps to doc/disksim-doc.ps
- remove all CVS/ directories
