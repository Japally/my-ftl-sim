1. Running simulator

We have prepared a script to run the simulator using real block I/O trace
in (./trace/test.file). You may test the simulator by typing  

"./runtest"

2. Setting flash type

You can change the flash type in the parameter file. 
Search for "FTL type = " in the parameter file. 
  - 1 is for page-mapped FTL. 
  - 3 is for DFTL. 
  - 4 is for FAST FTL scheme. 

3. Adjust the capacity of flash

You can change total number of blocks in flash. 
Search for "Block count = " in the parameter file. 
We have set the block size 128KB. 
Similarly you can adjust extra number of block in flash. 
This is extra space which is not counted as unique data blocks in the flash.
